   <h1>Topic life in big cities</h1> 
  <b>

  </b> <h2>Advantages of a big city</h2><hr>
    <p> This is first paragraph of my topic that is City life is often romanticized. Books, television and movies have presented it as bursting from the seams with adventure, culture and a wealth of possibilities.
        . Making it big in the big city has been a mantra for young people for decades, and not without good reason. But realistically, not everyone is going to enjoy the hustle and bustle of an urban environment.<strong> How do you decide whether you should be living in a big city?</strong>
<br>
        It time to step back and take a careful look at your options. Like everything else, living in the city has advantages and disadvantages. <em>Some are logistical, like expenses and housing. Others are deeply personal — family connections, job opportunities, sports teams, the list goes on</em> </p>
